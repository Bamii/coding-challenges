## Hacker Goods

Have you ever heard of hackernews? If you did, you know that it looks **quite bad**:

[HN](http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/img_uploads/SEOmoz-Hackernews-Rank.png)

What we request is to write make hackernews beautiful. **Really** beautiful.

You can fetch the HN data from the [unofficial API](http://api.ihackernews.com/page) and
use SASS, LESS, Stylus or whatever, the important thing is that the code is clean, consistent and crystal clear.

Add JS animations (jQuery or angular, we don't really care at this point :)) to make it spicy enough and then send us:

* 1 `index.html`
* 1 JS file
* 1 stylesheet (if you use a preprocessor, sends us the preprocessed one)

So that we can have a look at it!
